A Facade Pattern says that just "just provide a unified and simplified

interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, 

therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client".

In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

Practically, every Abstract Factory is a type of Facade.

--Real World Example

Imagine how it would be if you had to adjust n number of valves and controllers. 
The facade you have got is just a key hole. 
On turn of a key it send instruction to multiple subsystems and executes a 
sequence of operation and completes the objective. 
All you know is a key turn which acts as a facade and simplifies your job.
