Flyweight pattern is used when there is a need to create large number of object of almost similar in nature.
The large number of object consume a large amount of memory and the flyweight design pattern provides a solution for reducing the load on memory by sharing objects.


Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of object created,to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.
Flyweight pattern try to reuse already existing similar similar kind of objects by storing them and creates new object when no matching object is found.


1-Intrinsic [Intrinsic state are things that are constant and stored in the memory]
2-Extrinsic [Extrinsic state are things that are not constant and needs to be calculated on the fly,and are therefore not stored in the memory]

e.g===>Circle are instrinc but multiple color is extrinsic
